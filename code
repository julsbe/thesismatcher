1. Collecting Student Data
You'll prompt the user to enter their courses and interests, then store these in lists.
  
  def get_student_data():
    courses = input("Enter the courses you took, separated by commas: ").split(',')
    interests = input("Enter your interests, separated by commas: ").split(',')
    return courses, interests

courses, interests = get_student_data()

  2. Fetching University Data (Web Scraping)
For simplicity, let's assume you're scraping a webpage with a list of professors and their interests. You'll use Beautiful Soup for this.
  
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

def fetch_university_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Example scraping logic, assuming a certain HTML structure
    professors = {}
    for prof in soup.find_all('div', class_='professor'):
        name = prof.find('h3').text
        interests = [i.strip() for i in prof.find('p', class_='interests').text.split(',')]
        professors[name] = interests
    return professors

# Example URL (you'll need to replace this with the actual one)
professors = fetch_university_data('http://example.com/university/professors')

  3. Matching Algorithm
Match student's interests with professors' interests.

def match_professors(student_interests, professors):
    matches = {}
    for name, interests in professors.items():
        if any(interest in student_interests for interest in interests):
            matches[name] = interests
    return matches

matched_professors = match_professors(interests, professors)

  4. Retrieving Professor Profiles from Google Scholar (Simplified)
Here, you'll use a static mock-up for simplicity.

  professor_profiles = {
    "Dr. Smith": ["Paper 1 Title", "Paper 2 Title"],
    # ... other mock profiles
}

def get_professor_papers(professor_name):
    return professor_profiles.get(professor_name, [])

  5. Drafting an Email using OpenAI API
Use OpenAI's GPT model to generate email drafts. You'll need an API key from OpenAI for this.

  import openai

def draft_email(student_name, professor_name):
    openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

    prompt = f"Draft an email from a student, {student_name}, to a professor, {professor_name}, asking about thesis opportunities in their field of interest."

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

email_draft = draft_email("Student Name", "Professor Name")
print(email_draft)


6. Providing Multiple Professor Options
Present matched professors and let the student choose.

def choose_professor(matches):
    print("Matched Professors:")
    for i, (name, interests) in enumerate(matches.items(), 1):
        print(f"{i}. {name} - Interests: {', '.join(interests)}")
    choice = int(input("Choose a professor by number: "))
    return list(matches.keys())[choice - 1]

chosen_professor = choose_professor(matched_professors)


  7. User Interface and Integration
Combine all the parts in a main function.

  def main():
    courses, student_interests = get_student_data()
    professors = fetch_university_data('http://example.com/university/professors')
    matched_professors = match_professors(student_interests, professors)
    chosen_professor = choose_professor(matched_professors)
    papers = get_professor_papers(chosen_professor)
    print(f"Papers by {chosen_professor}: {', '.join(papers)}")
    email = draft_email("Your Name", chosen_professor)
    print("Draft Email:\n", email)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
