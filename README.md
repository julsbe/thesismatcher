Collecting Student Data:

Use input() function to prompt the student for their courses and interests.
Example Task: "Write a Python script that asks the user to input the names of courses they've taken and their interests, storing these in a list."

Simplified Data Retrieval:
Since web scraping and API interactions are advanced topics, instead, use a predefined dictionary of professors and their interests.
Example Task: "Create a dictionary in Python where keys are professor names and values are their interests. This will simulate data normally retrieved from a website."

Basic Matching Logic:
Write a function to match student interests with professor interests using simple string comparison and loops.
Example Task: "Develop a Python function that takes student interests and matches them with the professors' interests in your dictionary, returning the names of matching professors."

Mock Professor Profiles:
Google Scholar API: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62938110/does-google-scholar-have-an-api-available-that-we-can-use-in-our-research-applic
Rather than fetching real data from Google Scholar, create mock profiles for professors with fictional papers.
Example Task: "Create a list of mock paper titles for each professor and display these when a professor is matched with a student."

Basic Email Drafting:
OpenAI API: https://community.openai.com/t/integrating-gpt-with-gmail-api-for-draft-emails/351952
Use string concatenation to create a simple email draft template.
Example Task: "Write a Python function that generates an email draft to a professor using the student's name and the professor's name, filling these into a predefined template."

Console-based User Interface:
Build a simple console interface using print() and input() functions for interaction.
Example Task: "Create a menu-driven console application where the student can enter their details, get matched with professors, and see email drafts."

Error Handling:
Implement basic error handling using try-except blocks for user inputs.
Example Task: "Add error handling to your input functions to ensure the student enters valid data."

Testing:
Manually test each part of your code to ensure it works as expected.
Example Task: "Perform manual tests on your application by entering different sets of inputs and checking if the outputs are correct."

Integration and Incremental Development:
Start by developing and testing individual components (like data collection, matching logic) before integrating them.
Gradually build up the complexity of your project.
